Write a Node.js and MongoDB script to perform CRUD operations on a collection named "ecommerce_shipment_order_details". The collection should have the following fields:

order_id (string, unique)
customer_name (string)
customer_email (string)
customer_address (string)
product_name (string)
quantity (number)
total_price (number)
order_status (string)
The script should be able to perform the following operations:

Create a new order: given a JSON object with the order's data, insert it into the "ecommerce_shipment_order_details" collection. If the order_id already exists in the collection, return an error message.

Read an order: given an order_id, retrieve the order's data from the "ecommerce_shipment_order_details" collection and return it as a JSON object. If the order does not exist, return an error message.

Update an order: given an order_id and a JSON object with the order's new data, update the corresponding order in the "ecommerce_shipment_order_details" collection. If the order_id already exists in the collection (except for the order being updated), return an error message.

Delete an order: given an order_id, delete the corresponding order from the "ecommerce_shipment_order_details" collection. If the order does not exist, return an error message.

List all orders: retrieve all the orders from the "ecommerce_shipment_order_details" collection and return them as an array of JSON objects.

List orders by status: given an order_status, retrieve all the orders with that status from the "ecommerce_shipment_order_details" collection and return them as an array of JSON objects.

Your solution should be written using the official MongoDB driver for Node.js.
